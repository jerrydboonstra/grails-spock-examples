#summary Overview of all examples.

= Introduction =
This project contains examples how to test a grails example with Spock.

Here's the current setup:

== Domain classes ==
  * [https://code.google.com/p/grails-spock-examples/source/browse/trunk/grails-geb-spock/grails-app/domain/grails/geb/spock/Author.groovy Author]: Consists of a firstname, a lastname and a list of books
  * [https://code.google.com/p/grails-spock-examples/source/browse/trunk/grails-geb-spock/grails-app/domain/grails/geb/spock/Book.groovy Book]: Consists of a title and an author

== Services ==

  * [https://code.google.com/p/grails-spock-examples/source/browse/trunk/grails-geb-spock/grails-app/services/grails/geb/spock/GuttenbergService.groovy GuttenbergService]: Contains a method to create a dummy book (Mr. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Theodor_zu_Guttenberg#Doctorate_plagiarism Guttenberg] is a german politican)


= Mocked unit tests =
Examples how to test your code with mocks and Spock

== Unit tests for domain classes ==

=== Testing dynamic finders ===
e.g. test if you can find an author by it's firstname and lastname after creating a new instance

{{{
def "find author by firstname and lastname"() {
          setup:
          mockDomain(Author)

          when:
          new Author(firstname: firstname,lastname:lastname).save()

          then:
          Author.findByFirstnameAndLastname(firstname,lastname) != null

          where:
          firstname = "John"
          lastname = "Doe"
   }
}}}

  * [https://code.google.com/p/grails-spock-examples/source/browse/trunk/grails-geb-spock/test/unit/grails/geb/spock/domain/BookSpec.groovy BookSpec]


=== Testing constraints ===
e.g. test if it possible to create a new author with a firstname with more than 20 characters

{{{
def "firstname not longer than 20 characters"() {
          setup:
          mockForConstraintsTests(Author)

          when:
          def author =new Author(firstname: firstname,lastname:lastname)
          author.validate()

          then:
          author.hasErrors()

          where:
          firstname = "123456789012345678901"
          lastname = "Doe"
   }
}}}

==Testing services == 
Example:

{{{
def "when creating a new thesis author is assigned to thesis"() {
    //2. Setup mocks
    setup:
    //Enable logging for GuttenbergService
    mockLogging(GuttenbergService, true)
    //Create GuttenbergServce
    def guttenbergService = new GuttenbergService()
    //Use the author object created in the "where" statement to create mocked domain objects.
    //In this step, the author instance get's the ID assigned
    mockDomain(Author, [authorInstance])
    //Mock domain class book (required by the guttenberg service)
    mockDomain(Book)

    //3. Call the method to test
    when:
    def thesis = guttenbergService.createThesis(authorInstance.id)

    then:
    //4. Make asserts on the result
    thesis != null
    thesis.author.id == authorInstance.id

    //1. Create a dummy author instance used for the test. This instance has NO id yet
    where:
    authorInstance = new Author(firstname: "John", lastname: "Doe")
  }
}}}

== Testing controllers ==

= Integration tests = 

== Testing services ==
Take a look at the [https://code.google.com/p/grails-spock-examples/source/browse/trunk/grails-geb-spock/grails-app/conf/BootStrap.groovy BootStrap] what objects are created in the DB before the the integration tests are started


Example for an integration test with Spock:

{{{

class GuttenbergServiceIntegrationSpec extends IntegrationSpec {

  def guttenbergService

  def "Create thesis for first author in DB"() {

    when:
    def thesis = guttenbergService.createThesis(authorId)

    then:
    thesis != null
    Book.countByAuthor(author) == 2

    where:
    authorId = 1L
    author = Author.get(authorId)
  }
}

}}}
